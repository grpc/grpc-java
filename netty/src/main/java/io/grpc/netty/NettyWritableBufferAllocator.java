/**
 * The default allocator for {@link NettyWritableBuffer}s used by the Netty transport. We set a
 * minimum bound to avoid unnecessary re-allocation for small follow-on writes and to facilitate
 * Netty's caching of buffer objects for small writes. We set an upper-bound to avoid allocations
 * outside of the arena-pool which are orders of magnitude slower. The Netty transport can receive
 * buffers of arbitrary size and will chunk them based on flow-control so there is no transport
 * requirement for an upper bound.
 *
 * <p>Note: It is assumed that most applications will be using Netty's direct buffer pools for
 * maximum performance.
