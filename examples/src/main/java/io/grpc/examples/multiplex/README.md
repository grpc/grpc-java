gRPC Multiplex Example
=====================

gRPC multiplexing refers to the ability of a single gRPC connection to handle multiple independent streams of communication simultaneously. 
This is part of the HTTP/2 protocol on which gRPC is built. 
Each gRPC connection supports multiple streams that can carry different RPCs, making it highly efficient for high-throughput, low-latency communication.

In gRPC, sharing resources like channels and servers can improve efficiency and resource utilization.

- Sharing gRPC Channels and Servers

  1. Shared gRPC Channel:
     - A single gRPC channel can be used by multiple stubs, enabling different service clients to communicate over the same connection.
     - This minimizes the overhead of establishing and managing multiple connections

  2. Shared gRPC Server:
     - A single gRPC channel can be used by multiple stubs, enabling different service clients to communicate over the same connection.
     - This minimizes the overhead of establishing and managing multiple connections    

This example demonstrates how to implement a gRPC server that serves both a GreetingService and an EchoService, and a client that shares a single channel across multiple stubs for both services.
