/**
 * Provides APIs for managing gRPC channels to an S2A server. Each channel is local and plaintext.
 * If credentials are provided, they are used to secure the channel.
 *
 * <p>This is done as follows: for an S2A server, provides an implementation of gRPC's {@link
 * SharedResourceHolder.Resource} interface called a {@code Resource<Channel>}. A {@code
 * Resource<Channel>} is a factory for creating gRPC channels to the S2A server at a given address,
 * and a channel must be returned to the {@code Resource<Channel>} when it is no longer needed.
 *
 * <p>Typical usage pattern is below:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Resource<Channel> resource = S2AHandshakerServiceChannel.getChannelResource("localhost:1234",
 * creds);
 * Channel channel = resource.create();
 * // Send an RPC over the channel to the S2A server running at localhost:1234.
 * resource.close(channel);
 * }</pre>
