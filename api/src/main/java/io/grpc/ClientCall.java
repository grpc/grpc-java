/**
 * An instance of a call to a remote method. A call will send zero or more
 * request messages to the server and receive zero or more response messages back.
 *
 * <p>Instances are created
 * by a {@link Channel} and used by stubs to invoke their remote behavior.
 *
 * <p>More advanced usages may consume this interface directly as opposed to using a stub. Common
 * reasons for doing so would be the need to interact with flow-control or when acting as a generic
 * proxy for arbitrary operations.
 *
 * <p>{@link #start} must be called prior to calling any other methods, with the exception of
 * {@link #cancel}. Whereas {@link #cancel} must not be followed by any other methods,
 * but can be called more than once, while only the first one has effect.
 *
 * <p>No generic method for determining message receipt or providing acknowledgement is provided.
 * Applications are expected to utilize normal payload messages for such signals, as a response
 * naturally acknowledges its request.
 *
 * <p>Methods are guaranteed to be non-blocking. Not thread-safe except for {@link #request}, which
 * may be called from any thread.
 *
 * <p>There is no interaction between the states on the {@link Listener Listener} and {@link
 * ClientCall}, i.e., if {@link Listener#onClose Listener.onClose()} is called, it has no bearing on
 * the permitted operations on {@code ClientCall} (but it may impact whether they do anything).
 *
 * <p>There is a race between {@link #cancel} and the completion/failure of the RPC in other ways.
 * If {@link #cancel} won the race, {@link Listener#onClose Listener.onClose()} is called with
 * {@link Status#CANCELLED CANCELLED}. Otherwise, {@link Listener#onClose Listener.onClose()} is
 * called with whatever status the RPC was finished. We ensure that at most one is called.
 *
 * <h3>Usage examples</h3>
 * <h4>Simple Unary (1 request, 1 response) RPC</h4>
 * <pre>
 *   call = channel.newCall(unaryMethod, callOptions);
 *   call.start(listener, headers);
 *   call.sendMessage(message);
 *   call.halfClose();
 *   call.request(1);
 *   // wait for listener.onMessage()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Flow-control in Streaming RPC</h4>
 *
 * <p>The following snippet demonstrates a bi-directional streaming case, where the client sends
 * requests produced by a fictional <code>makeNextRequest()</code> in a flow-control-compliant
 * manner, and notifies gRPC library to receive additional response after one is consumed by
 * a fictional <code>processResponse()</code>.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   call = channel.newCall(bidiStreamingMethod, callOptions);
 *   listener = new ClientCall.Listener&lt;FooResponse&gt;() {
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void onMessage(FooResponse response) {
 *       processResponse(response);
 *       // Notify gRPC to receive one additional response.
 *       call.request(1);
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void onReady() {
 *       while (call.isReady()) {
 *         FooRequest nextRequest = makeNextRequest();
 *         if (nextRequest == null) {  // No more requests to send
 *           call.halfClose();
 *           return;
 *         }
 *         call.sendMessage(nextRequest);
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *   call.start(listener, headers);
 *   // Notify gRPC to receive one response. Without this line, onMessage() would never be called.
 *   call.request(1);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>DO NOT MOCK: Use InProcessServerBuilder and make a test server instead.
 *
